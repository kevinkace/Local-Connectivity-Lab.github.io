LCL works in partnership with the University of Washington (UW) to share free or low-cost broadband access in higher-need areas throughout the city, making use of existing city network infrastructure such as buildings and fiber-optic cables to extend coverage to more people. Our mission is to facilitate community focused technology development and research in support of low-income, marginalized populations and groups.
